Merchant Upgrade Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview

This project analyzes merchant behavior to understand and predict which merchants are most likely to upgrade their subscription plan in the next quarter. The goal is to identify key business drivers behind upgrade decisions and provide actionable insights for sales and marketing teams.

Objectives
	•	Analyze merchant performance and usage metrics
	•	Identify key factors influencing plan upgrades
	•	Visualize patterns and trends using data analytics tools
	•	Build an interactive dashboard to support business decision-making

Dataset Description

The dataset contains simulated merchant data including:
	•	Monthly revenue
	•	Number of orders
	•	Revenue growth (QoQ)
	•	Apps installed
	•	Website traffic
	•	Support tickets
	•	Upgrade status for the next quarter

The dataset includes missing values and duplicates to reflect real-world data challenges.

Data Analysis & Visualization
	•	Python was used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial visualizations.
	•	Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to explore relationships between revenue, growth, usage, and upgrade behavior.
	•	Key insights were validated visually before building the dashboard.

Tableau Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created using Tableau Public to present insights in a business-friendly format.
The dashboard includes:
	•	Executive KPIs (Total Merchants, Upgraded Merchants, Upgrade Rate)
	•	Revenue vs Orders scatter plot by upgrade status
	•	Apps Installed and Revenue Growth analysis
	•	Key drivers influencing upgrade decisions

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly identify high-potential merchants and understand upgrade readiness.

Key Insights
	•	Revenue alone is not sufficient to predict merchant upgrades
	•	Merchants with higher growth and more installed apps show a higher likelihood of upgrading
	•	Usage and engagement metrics play a critical role in upgrade decisions

Tools & Technologies
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Google Colab
	•	Tableau Public
	•	GitHub

Deliverables
	•	Python notebook for data analysis and visualization
	•	Tableau Public dashboard
	•	Presentation slides and recorded presentation video

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining Python-based analysis with Tableau dashboards can transform raw data into actionable business insights. The results highlight the importance of usage and growth metrics in predicting merchant upgrades and support data-driven decision-making.
