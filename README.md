Shopify Merchant Upgrade Prediction

This project focuses on predicting which Shopify merchants are most likely to upgrade their subscription plan in the next quarter using a data-driven approach.

The goal of this analysis is to help business and sales teams prioritize high-potential merchants by identifying early growth signals beyond revenue alone.

The dataset used in this project is a simulated and anonymized Shopify merchant dataset that includes information about merchant activity, revenue, growth metrics, app usage, and support interactions.
